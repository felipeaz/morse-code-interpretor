# morse-code-interpretor
A morse code is built by a sequence of signals represented by dot(.) and dash (-). This is a code challenge where the user input a sequence of three digits that may
contain dots, dashes and unknown signal represented by (?). The morse code interpretor will identify which letter the signal represents and if an unknown signal is identified, it'll bring all possibilities that matches the pattern. 

The Dichotomic Morse Code Table was used to define each letter code signal in dots and dashes.
