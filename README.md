# morse-code-interpretor
A morse code is built by a sequence of signals represented by dot(.) and dash (-). This is a code challenge where the user input a sequence of three digits that may
contain dots, dashes and an unknown signal represented by (?). The morse code interpretor will identify which letter that signal represents, if an unknown signal is identified, it'll bring all possibilities for that particular signal. 

The Dichotomic Morse Code Table was used to define each letter code signal in dots and dashes.
